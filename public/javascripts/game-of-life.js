 * subtract them from the list of cells
 * Then when you've ran out of neighbors by neighbors that's a group
 * then you can grab the first item out of the list of cells that 
 * hasn't been removed yet.
 * This will get you groups, not sure if this helps anything though, 
 * or maybe it's a fast way to go about things iterating off of 
 * this idea for grabing your collection to run against.
